# OFFWall

OFFWall is an OpenFlow 1.3 compatible controller dedicated to firewall bypassing via CSV files.
It only implements the features that are needed to proactively install flow entries onto a connected switch.

This Rust crate is part of Bastian Germann's Master thesis, which explains it in detail:
Implementierung eines reduzierten OpenFlow Controller f√ºr Firewall Bypassing in der Praxis.
