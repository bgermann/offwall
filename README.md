# OFFWall

OFFWall is an OpenFlow 1.3 compatible controller dedicated to firewall bypassing via CSV files.
It only implements the features that are needed to proactively install flow entries onto a connected switch.

This Rust software project is part of Bastian Germann's Master thesis, which explains it in detail:
Implementation of a reduced OpenFlow Controller for firewall bypassing in practice.

You can find information about compiling and packaging in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
